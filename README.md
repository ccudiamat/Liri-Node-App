# Liri-Node-App
This is my version of the LIRI Node App.

## What Is LIRI

LIRI is a CLI app in which it takes in a user input and lists the result, based on their search action. The choices of actions are:
```
concert-this
```
```
spotify-this-song
```
```
movie-this
```
```
do-what-it-says
```

## Screenshots
