# Liri-Node-App
This is my version of the LIRI Node App.

LIRI is a CLI app in which it takes in a user input and lists the result, based on their search action. The choices of actions are:

1) movie-this <user-input>

2) spotify-this song <user-input>

3) concert-this <user-input>

4) do-what-it-says

movie-this (with user input)

movie-this (when user input is undefined)
![movie-this-undefined](/screenshots/movie-this-undefined.png)

spotify-this-song (with user input)
